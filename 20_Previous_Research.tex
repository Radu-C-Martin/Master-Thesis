\section{Previous Research}
With the increase in computational power and availability of data  over time the
accesibility of data-driven methods for System Identfication and Control has
also risen significantly. 

The idea of using Gaussian Processes as regression models for control of dynamic
systems is not new, and has already been explored a number of times. A general
description of their use, along with the necessary theory and some example
implementations is given in {\color{red} Add citation to the Gaussian Process
for dynamic models textbook}

Gaussian Processes for building control have been studied before in the context
of Demand Response, {\color{orange} where the buildings are used for their heat
capacity in order to reduce the stress on energy provides during peak load times}

% TODO: [Previous Research] Finish with need for adaptive schemes
