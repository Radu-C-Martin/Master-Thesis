These optimal controllers are able to minimize the energy use within building, by taking into account the weather forecast and occupancy profiles, while guaranteeing thermal comfort in the building. To this end, they anticipate the dynamic behaviour based on a mathematical model of the system. However, these MPC strategies are still not widely used in practice because a substantial engineering effort is needed to identify a tailored model for each building and Heat Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system.},

In particular, we combine building thermodynamics (slow), and energy storage systems (fast resources) to augment the flexibility that can be provided to the grid compared to the flexibility that any of these resources can provide individually. A multilevel control scheme based on data-based robust optimization methods is developed that enables heterogeneous resources at different time scales (slow and fast) to provide fast regulation services, especially a secondary frequency control service. A data-based predictor is developed to forecast the future regulation signal and is used to improve the performance of the controller in real-time operation. The proposed control method is used to conduct experiments, for nine consecutive days, demonstrating the provision of secondary frequency control fully complying to the Swiss regulations, using a controllable building cooling system on the EPFL campus and an emulated grid-connected energy storage system. The experimental results show that optimally combining such slow and fast resources can significantly augment the flexibility that can be provided to the grid. To the best of author’s knowledge, this work is the first experimental demonstration of coordinating heterogeneous demandresponse to provide secondary frequency control service.},

  abstract = {Bayesian Optimization (BO) is useful for optimizing functions that are expensive to evaluate, lack an analytical expression and whose evaluations can be contaminated by noise. These methods rely on a probabilistic model of the objective function, typically a Gaussian process (GP), upon which an acquisition function is built. The acquisition function guides the optimization process and measures the expected utility of performing an evaluation of the objective at a new point. GPs assume continuous input variables. When this is not the case, for example when some of the input variables take categorical or integer values, one has to introduce extra approximations. Consider a suggested input location taking values in the real line. Before doing the evaluation of the objective, a common approach is to use a one hot encoding approximation for categorical variables, or to round to the closest integer, in the case of integer-valued variables. We show that this can lead to optimization problems and describe a more principled approach to account for input variables that are categorical or integer-valued. We illustrate in both synthetic and a real experiments the utility of our approach, which significantly improves the results of standard BO methods using Gaussian processes on problems with categorical or integer-valued variables.},

  abstract = {Building physics-based models of complex physical systems like buildings and chemical plants is extremely cost and time prohibitive for applications such as real-time optimal control, production planning and supply chain logistics. Machine learning algorithms can reduce this cost and time complexity, and are, consequently, more scalable for large-scale physical systems. However, there are many practical challenges that must be addressed before employing machine learning for closed-loop control. This paper proposes the use of Gaussian Processes (GP) for learning control-oriented models: (1) We develop methods for the optimal experiment design (OED) of functional tests to learn models of a physical system, subject to stringent operational constraints and limited availability of the system. Using a Bayesian approach with GP, our methods seek to select the most informative data for optimally updating an existing model. (2) We also show that black-box GP models can be used for receding horizon optimal control with probabilistic guarantees on constraint satisfaction through chance constraints. (3) We further propose an online method for continuously improving the GP model in closed-loop with a real-time controller. Our methods are demonstrated and validated in a case study of building energy control and Demand Response.},

Furnishing elements and indoor items have complicated shapes and are made of various materials. Therefore, most of the people prefer to ignore them. However, this simplification can be problematic for accurate calculation of the transient indoor temperature. This article firstly reviews different solutions to include the indoor content in building models and suggests typical values for its characteristics. Secondly, the paper presents the results of a numerical study investigating the influence of the different types of thermal inertia on buildings energy flexibility. Although the insulation level and thermal mass of a building envelope are the dominant parameters, it appears that indoor content cannot be neglected for lightweight structure building simulations. Finally, it is shown that the integration of phase change materials in wallboards or furniture elements can appreciably improve the energy flexibility of buildings.},

  abstract = {In the early 90th the IBOIS-EPFL developed a new kind of shell structure. The ribs were made with simple planks which are waved together to build a spacial ribbed shell. The first application was the Polydome in 1993, and the most fascinating has been the Expodach in Hannover in year 2000 [1]. However, the calculation and the realization of such structures requires particular knowledge and experience. That is’s why the construction of such structures is something exceptional. In addition to the anisotropy of material wood, the spatial structure of laminated and screwed beams has a structural anisotropy. They constitute highly unspecified static systems. Currently the engineer does not have any effective method to calculate these kinds of spatial structures, made out of curved screwed lamellate boards. The existing approximations for complex curved structures are not satisfying. The main differences are noticed especially upon the analysis of the stability of structures subject to horizontal loads. The following article will compare a 6-layered beam with inter-layer slips in different load cases and situations. The beam is composed of 6 planks with a section of 140/27mm. The connections between the layers are screws. The studied parameters are the distance between the connector, the length of the beam and 3 different load cases. A total of 24 elements have been tested and compared between the laboratory test and different theories. A very important parameter is the stiffness of the connector. Thus additional tests have been made to simulate the stiffness of the screws used. A bi-exponential law has been generated to be used in the theoretical evaluation of the tests. The actual theories which have been used to simulate the behavior of the sample are gamma- Method of Möhler-Schelling, Appendix F of the Germand standard E- DIN 1052 of Prof. Kreuzinger, framework systems developed by Kneidl and Hartmann and finally a multiy-layer finite element developed at the LSC- EPFL by Prof. Frei and Dr. Krawczyk.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) framework for building energy system setpoint optimization is developed and tested. The performance of the MPC framework is presented in comparison to a baseline case, where a fixed setpoint schedule is used. To simulate the MPC procedure, an EnergyPlus building model is used to represent the actual building that the optimal setpoints are applied to, and a Gaussian process (GP) regression meta-model is used in the MPC procedure that generates the optimal setpoints. The performance outputs that are used for evaluation are total heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) energy usage and the Fanger predicted mean vote (PMV) thermal comfort measure. The inputs for the GP regression meta-models are selected to be representative of data points that could be obtained by modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to support data-driven building models. The supervisory MPC framework is capable of reducing the total energy usage with minor adjustments in thermal comfort.},
